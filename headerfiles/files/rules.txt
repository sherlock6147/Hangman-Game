Thank you for bothering to read the rules.

the QUESTION MASTER asks the question to the PLAYER
the QUESTION MASTER sets the question and its answer for the user
the PLAYER gets a turn to guess the answer till the man is not hanged
on hanging the QUESTION MASTER is awarded 1 point else the PLAYER is awarded 1 point
after this the QUESTION MASTER and the PLAYER exchange roles and keep playing till they want to.
Thank you , Now lets get going
